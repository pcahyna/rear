# This script is an improvement over the default grub-install '(hd0)'
#
# However the following issues still exist:
#
#  * We don't know what the first disk will be, so we cannot be sure the MBR
#    is written to the correct disk(s). That's why we make all disks bootable.
#
#  * There is no guarantee that GRUB was the boot loader used originally.
#    One possible attempt would be to save and restore the MBR for each disk,
#    but this does not guarantee a correct boot order,
#    or even a working boot loader config
#    (eg. GRUB stage2 might not be at the exact same location).

# Skip if another boot loader is already installed
# (then $NOBOOTLOADER is not a true value cf. finalize/default/010_prepare_checks.sh):
is_true $NOBOOTLOADER || return 0

# For UEFI systems with grub legacy with should use efibootmgr instead:
is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER && return

# If the BOOTLOADER variable (read by finalize/default/010_prepare_checks.sh)
# is not "GRUB" (which means GRUB Legacy) skip this script (which is only for GRUB Legacy)
# because finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh is for installing GRUB 2
# and finalize/Linux-i386/650_install_elilo.sh is for installing elilo:
test "GRUB" = "$BOOTLOADER" || return 0

# If the BOOTLOADER variable is "GRUB" (which means GRUB Legacy)
# do not unconditionally trust that because https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/589
# reads (excerpt):
#   Problems found:
#   The ..._install_grub.sh checked for GRUB2 which is not part
#   of the first 2048 bytes of a disk - only GRUB was present -
#   thus the check for grub-probe/grub2-probe
# and https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/079de45b3ad8edcf0e3df54ded53fe955abded3b
# reads (excerpt):
#    replace grub-install by grub-probe
#    as grub-install also exist in legacy grub
# so that it seems there are cases where actually GRUB 2 is used
# but wrongly detected as "GRUB" so that another test is needed
# to detect if actually GRUB 2 is used.
# When GRUB 2 is installed we assume GRUB 2 is used as boot loader
# so that then we skip this script (which is only for GRUB Legacy)
# because finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh is for installing GRUB 2:
