= BLOCKCLONE as backup method

BLOCKCLONE backup method is a bit distinct type of backup, which works directly
 with block devices. It allows running backups of any kind of block device that
 can be read/write by Linux drivers and save them to e.g. NFS share or USB
 drive for later restore. It currently integrates Disk Dump (dd) and ntfsclone
 (from ntfs-3g package). With BLOCKCLONE, user is also able to make full backup
 and restore of dual boot (Linux / Windows) environments. +
Another potential use-case for the BLOCKCLONE method is to copy an encrypted
 filesystem including the encryption layer by imaging the underlying block device. 
 This means that all existing encryption keys will be preserved and that the 
 resulting backup file (the image generated by `dd`) will itself remain encrypted.

== Limitations
- Works only directly with disk partitions (or Logical Volumes using `dd`)
- GPT not supported (work in progress)
- No UEFI support (work in progress)
- Linux family boot loader must be used as primary
 (Windows bootloader was not tested)
- Restore should be done to same sized or larger disks
- Tests were made with Windows 7/10 with NFS and USB as destinations.
 Other ReaR backup destinations like SMB or FTP might however work as well.

== Warning!
ReaR with BLOCKCLONE is capable of doing backup of Linux/Windows dual boot
 environments. There is however a need for some basic knowledge on how the
 source OS is set up. Things like boot loader device location, Linux/Windows
 partitioning and file system layout are essential for backup setup. +
*Always test before relying on this approach!*

== Examples

=== 1. Backup/restore of arbitrary block device with BLOCKCLONE and dd on NFS server

==== Configuration
This is very basic and most simple scenario where we will do backup
 of single partition (_/dev/sdc1_) located on separate disk (_/dev/sdc_). +
First we need to set some global options in _local.conf_,
 like target for backups.
In our small example backups will be stored in _/mnt/rear_ directory
 on BACKUP_URL NFS server.

--------------------------
# cat local.conf
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://<hostname>/mnt/rear
--------------------------

Now we will define variables that will apply only for targeted block device

--------------------------
# cat alien.conf
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE                                        # Define BLOCKCLONE as backup method
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="alien"                              # Name of image file
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".dd.img"                             # Suffix of image file
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""                           # Don't use additional suffixes

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=dd                                       # Use dd for image creation
BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS="bs=4k"                             # Additional options that will be passed to dd
BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sdc1"                        # Device that should be backed up

BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sdc"                       # Device where partitioning information is stored (optional)
BLOCKCLONE_MBR_FILE="alien_boot_strap.img"               # Output filename for boot strap code
BLOCKCLONE_PARTITIONS_CONF_FILE="alien_partitions.conf"  # Output filename for partition configuration

BLOCKCLONE_ALLOW_MOUNTED="yes"                           # Device can be mounted during backup (default NO)
--------------------------

==== Running backup
Save partitions configuration, bootstrap code and create actual backup of /dev/sdc1
--------------------------
# rear -C alien mkbackuponly
--------------------------

==== Running restore from ReaR restore/recovery system
--------------------------
# rear -C alien restoreonly
Restore alien.dd.img to device: [/dev/sdc1]                 # User is always prompted for restore destination
Device /dev/sdc1 was not found.                             # If destination does not exist ReaR will try to create it (or fail if BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV was not set during backup)
Restore partition layout to (^c to abort): [/dev/sdc]       # Prompt user for device where partition configuration should be restored
Checking that no-one is using this disk right now ... OK

Disk /dev/sdc: 5 GiB, 5368709120 bytes, 10485760 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

Syncing disks.
--------------------------

==== Summary
In first example we have run backup of /dev/sdc1 partition and stored it on NFS
 server. Saved image was later restored from ReaR rescue/recovery system.
ReaRs BLOCKCLONE will always ask user for restore destination, so it is users
 responsibility to identify right target disk/partition prior restore.
 Unlike NETFS backup method, no guesses about target devices will be made!

TIP: One of easiest ways how to identify right disk could be its size. +
Running `fdisk -l <device_file>` could be helpful.

During restore phase ReaR recognized that target partition does not exist and
 asked if it should be created. If restore destination does not exist and
 BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV was set during backup, ReaR will try to deploy
 partition setup from saved configuration files (BLOCKCLONE_MBR_FILE and
 BLOCKCLONE_PARTITIONS_CONF_FILE) and continue with restore.

=== 2. Backup/restore of Linux / Windows 10 dual boot setup with each OS on separate disk

==== Configuration
In next example we will do backup/restore using BLOCKCLONE and `ntfsclone`
 of Linux (installed on /dev/sda) and Windows 10 (installed on /dev/sdb).

TIP: You can locate right disk devices using `df` and `os-prober`
--------------------------
# df -h /boot
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        10G  4.9G  5.2G  49% /           # Linux is most probably installed on /dev/sda

# os-prober
/dev/sdb1:Windows 10 (loader):Windows:chain       # Windows 10 is most probably installed on /dev/sdb
--------------------------

First we will configure some ReaR backup global options
 (similar to link:12-BLOCKCLONE.adoc#1-backuprestore-of-arbitrary-block-device-with-blockclone-and-dd-on-nfs-server[first example]
 we will do backup/restore with help of NFS server).

--------------------------
# cat local.conf
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://<hostname>/mnt/rear
REQUIRED_PROGS+=( ntfsclone )
--------------------------

Now we will define backup parameters for Linux.

--------------------------
# cat base_os.conf
this_file_name=$( basename ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} )
LOGFILE="$LOG_DIR/rear-$HOSTNAME-$WORKFLOW-${this_file_name%.*}.log"
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="backup-${this_file_name%.*}"
BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( '/media/*' )
--------------------------

Our Windows 10 is by default installed on two separate partitions
 (partition 1 for boot data and partition 2 for disk C:),
 so we will create two separate configuration files for each partition.

Windows boot partition:

--------------------------
# cat windows_boot.conf
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="windows_boot"
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".img"
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=ntfsclone
BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sdb1"
BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS="--quiet"

BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sdb"
BLOCKCLONE_MBR_FILE="windows_boot_strap.img"
BLOCKCLONE_PARTITIONS_CONF_FILE="windows_partitions.conf"
--------------------------

Windows data partition (disk C:\):
--------------------------
# cat windows_data.conf
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="windows_data"
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".img"
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=ntfsclone
BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sdb2"
BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS="--quiet"

BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sdb"
BLOCKCLONE_MBR_FILE="windows_boot_strap.img"
BLOCKCLONE_PARTITIONS_CONF_FILE="windows_partitions.conf"
--------------------------

==== Running backup
First we will create backup of Linux. `mkbackup` command will create bootable
 ISO image with ReaR rescue/recovery system that will be later used for
 booting broken system and consecutive recovery.
--------------------------
# rear -C base_os mkbackup
--------------------------

Now we create backup of Windows 10 boot partition. Command `mkbackuponly`
 will ensure that only partition data and partition layout will be saved
 (ReaR rescue/recovery system will not be created which is exactly what we want).
--------------------------
# rear -C windows_boot mkbackuponly
--------------------------

Similarly, we create backup of Windows 10 data partition (disk C:\)
--------------------------
# rear -C windows_data mkbackuponly
--------------------------

==== Running restore from ReaR restore/recovery system
As a first step after ReaR rescue/recovery system booted,
we will recover Linux. This step will recover all Linux file systems,
OS data and bootloader. Windows disk will remain untouched.
--------------------------
# rear -C base_os recover
--------------------------

In second step will recover Windows 10 boot partition. During this step ReaR
 will detect that destination partition is not present and ask us for device
 file where partition(s) should be created. It doesn't really matter whether
 we decide to recover Windows 10 boot or data partition first.
 `restoreonly` command ensures that previously restored Linux data and
 partition(s) configuration (currently mounted under _/mnt/local_) will
 remain untouched. Before starting Windows 10 recovery we should identify
 right disk for recovery, as mentioned earlier disk size could be a good start.
--------------------------
# fdisk -l /dev/sdb
Disk /dev/sdb: 50 GiB, 53687091200 bytes, 104857600 sectors
--------------------------

_/dev/sdb_ looks to be right destination, so we can proceed with restore.
--------------------------
# rear -C windows_boot restoreonly
Restore windows_boot.img to device: [/dev/sdb1]
Device /dev/sdb1 was not found.
Restore partition layout to (^c to abort): [/dev/sdb]
Checking that no-one is using this disk right now ... OK
...
--------------------------

Last step is to recover Windows 10 OS data (C:\).
Partitions on _/dev/sdb_ were already created in previous step,
hence ReaR will skip prompt for restoring partition layout.
--------------------------
# rear -C windows_data restoreonly
Restore windows_data.img to device: [/dev/sdb2]
Ntfsclone image version: 10.1
Cluster size           : 4096 bytes
Image volume size      : 33833349120 bytes (33834 MB)
Image device size      : 33833353216 bytes
Space in use           : 9396 MB (27.8%)
Offset to image data   : 56 (0x38) bytes
Restoring NTFS from image ...
...
--------------------------

At this stage Linux together with Windows 10 is successfully restored.

TIP: As Linux part is still mounted under _/mnt/local_, you can do some
 final configuration changes. e.g. adapt GRUB configuration, /etc/fstab,
 reinstall boot loader ...

TIP: ReaR will by default not include tools for mounting NTFS file systems. You
 can do it manually by adding
 `REQUIRED_PROGS+=( ntfsclone mount.ntfs-3g )`
 to your _local.conf_

=== 3. Backup/restore of Linux / Windows 10 dual boot setup sharing same disk

==== Configuration
In this example we will do backup/restore using BLOCKCLONE and `ntfsclone`
 of Linux and Windows 10 installed on same disk (_/dev/sda_).
 Linux is installed on partition _/dev/sda3_. Windows 10 is again divided into
 boot partition located on _/dev/sda1_ and OS data (C:/) located on _/dev/sda2_.
 Backups will be stored on NFS server.

First we set global ReaR options
--------------------------
# cat local.conf
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://<hostname>/mnt/rear
REQUIRED_PROGS+=( ntfsclone )

BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING="yes"
BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sda"

BLOCKCLONE_MBR_FILE="boot_strap.img"
BLOCKCLONE_PARTITIONS_CONF_FILE="partitions.conf"

--------------------------

IMPORTANT: BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING is mandatory if backing up
 Linux / Windows that shares one disk. Not using this option might result to
 unbootable Windows 10 installation.

Linux configuration
--------------------------
# cat base_os.conf
this_file_name=$( basename ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} )
LOGFILE="$LOG_DIR/rear-$HOSTNAME-$WORKFLOW-${this_file_name%.*}.log"
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="backup-${this_file_name%.*}"
BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( '/media/*' )
--------------------------

Windows 10 boot partition configuration
--------------------------
# cat windows_boot.conf
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE

BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="windows_boot"
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".nc.img"
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=ntfsclone
BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS="--quiet"

BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sda1"
--------------------------

Windows 10 data partition configuration
--------------------------
# cat windows_data.conf
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="windows_data"
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".nc.img"
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=ntfsclone
BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS="--quiet"

BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sda2"
--------------------------

==== Running backup

Backup of Linux
--------------------------
# rear -C base_os mkbackup
--------------------------

Backup of Windows 10 boot partition
--------------------------
# rear -C windows_boot mkbackuponly
--------------------------

Backup of Windows 10 data partition
--------------------------
# rear -C windows_data mkbackuponly
--------------------------

==== Running restore from ReaR restore/recovery system
Restore Linux
--------------------------
# rear -C base_os recover
--------------------------

During this step ReaR will also create both Windows 10 partitions

Restore Windows 10 data partition
--------------------------
# rear -C windows_data restoreonly
--------------------------

Restore Windows 10 boot partition
--------------------------
# rear -C windows_boot restoreonly
--------------------------

=== 4. Backup/restore of Linux / Windows 10 dual boot setup sharing same disk with USB as destination

==== Configuration
In this example we will do backup/restore using BLOCKCLONE and `ntfsclone`
 of Linux and Windows 10 installed on same disk (_/dev/sda_).
 Linux is installed on partition _/dev/sda3_. Windows 10 is again divided into
 boot partition located on _/dev/sda1_ and OS data (C:/) located on _/dev/sda2_.
 Backups will be stored on USB disk drive (_/dev/sdb_ in this example).

Global options
--------------------------
# cat local.conf
OUTPUT=USB
BACKUP=NETFS

USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

USB_SUFFIX="USB_backups"

GRUB_RESCUE=n
REQUIRED_PROGS+=( ntfsclone )

BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING="yes"
BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sda"

BLOCKCLONE_MBR_FILE="boot_strap.img"
BLOCKCLONE_PARTITIONS_CONF_FILE="partitions.conf"
--------------------------

Options used during Linux backup/restore.
--------------------------
# cat local.conf
OUTPUT=USB
BACKUP=NETFS

USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

USB_SUFFIX="USB_backups"

GRUB_RESCUE=n
REQUIRED_PROGS+=( ntfsclone )

BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING="yes"
BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sda"

BLOCKCLONE_MBR_FILE="boot_strap.img"
BLOCKCLONE_PARTITIONS_CONF_FILE="partitions.conf"
--------------------------

IMPORTANT: USB_SUFFIX option is mandatory as it avoids ReaR to hold every
 backup in separate directory, this behavior is essential for BLOCKCLONE
 backup method to work correctly.

Windows boot partition options
--------------------------
# cat windows_boot.conf
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE

BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="windows_boot"
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".nc.img"
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=ntfsclone
BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS="--quiet"

BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sda1"
--------------------------

Windows data partition options
--------------------------
# cat windows_data.conf
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="windows_data"
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".nc.img"
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=ntfsclone
BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS="--quiet"

BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sda2"
--------------------------

==== Running backup
First we need to format target USB device, with `rear format` command
--------------------------
# rear -v format /dev/sdb
Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-centosd.log

==== Running restore from ReaR restore/recovery system
For sake of this demonstration I've purposely used ReaR's rescue/recovery media
 (USB disk that holds our backed up Linux and Windows 10) as _/dev/sda_ and
 disk that will be used as restore destination as _/dev/sdb_. This will
 demonstrate possibility of ReaR to recover backup to arbitrary disk. +
As first step Linux will be restored, this will create all the partitions
 needed, even those used by Windows 10.

Again after restoreonly command is launched, ReaR prompts for restore

Now both operating systems are restored and we can reboot.

=== 5. Backup/restore of Linux to an NFS share with an encrypted device imaged using `dd`

==== Configuration
In this example we will split the backup of a Linux-only machine into two parts. First,
 we'll deal with the base OS the usual way (ignoring the encrypted filesystem), and 
 then we'll process that special filesystem (_/dev/vg00/lvol4_, mounted as 
 _/products_) using BLOCKCLONE and `dd`. +
As you will see, during the base OS restore phase, the encrypted filesystem will be
 recreated with new encyption keys (although empty, as _/products_ was ignored during
 the backup phase), but it will then be completely overwritten when we use `dd` to 
 restore the image in the last phase. +
The _BLOCKCLONE_TRY_UNMOUNT_ is important here: it will attempt to unmount the
 encrypted filesystem before creating its image and before restoring it. If 
 unmounting is impossible, do not dispair, the recovery should still work but
 you may need to manually repair the filesystem before you can mount it, and you 
 run the risk that the data may be inconsistent.

==== Running backup
Base OS backup:
--------------------------
# rear -C base_system mkbackup
--------------------------

Create image of encrypted filesystem:
--------------------------
# rear -C products_backup mkbackuponly
--------------------------

==== Running restore from ReaR restore/recovery system
First recover the base OS. This will create all the partitions needed, including
 the encrypted one (but it won't restore any data for the latter). +
As illustrated below, you will be prompted to chose a new encryption passphrase. 
 Please provide one, but you need not care about its value as it will get overwritten 
 during the next phase:
--------------------------
RESCUE pc-pan:~ # rear -C base_system.conf recover
[...]
Please enter the password for LUKS device cr_vg00-lvol4 (/dev/mapper/vg00-lvol4):
Enter passphrase for /dev/mapper/vg00-lvol4: 
Please re-enter the password for LUKS device cr_vg00-lvol4 (/dev/mapper/vg00-lvol4):
Enter passphrase for /dev/mapper/vg00-lvol4: 
Creating filesystem of type xfs with mount point /products on /dev/mapper/cr_vg00-lvol4.
Mounting filesystem /products
Disk layout created.
[...]
--------------------------

Now we can proceed and restore the encrypted filesystem image. The target filesystem
 will have been mounted by ReaR during the previous phase, but this will be 
 correctly handled by the restore script provided you set _BLOCKCLONE_TRY_UNMOUNT_
 to "yes". +
As illustrated below, you will be prompted for the target block device to use.
 Confirm by pressing Enter or type in another value:
--------------------------
RESCUE pc-pan:~ # rear -C products_backup.conf restoreonly
[...]
Restore backup-products_backup.dd.img to device: [/dev/vg00/lvol4]
[...]
--------------------------

Please note that the target device will not be re-mounted by the script at the end
 of the restore phase. If needed, this should be done manually. +
The recovered machine can now be rebooted. When prompted for the passphrase to 
 decrypt your filesystem, you should now provide the original one (the one you used 
 at the time the backup was made), and NOT the new one you typed during the recover
 phase.
